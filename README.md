# Java Streams Tutorial & Reference

## Introduction

Java Streams were introduced in **Java 8** as part of the java.util.stream package. They revolutionized data processing in Java by enabling **functional-style operations** on collections, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, in a declarative and concise manner. Streams allow you to process data in a pipeline, making code more readable and expressive.

## Why Streams?
- **Functional Programming:** Streams bring functional programming concepts (like map, filter, reduce) to Java, allowing you to write more declarative code.
- **Conciseness:** Stream operations are often more concise than traditional loops.
- **Readability:** Stream pipelines clearly express the intent of data transformations.
- **Parallel Processing:** Streams can be easily parallelized for multicore performance gains.
- **Chaining:** Multiple operations can be chained together in a single pipeline.

## Limitations & Disadvantages
- **One-time Use:** Streams cannot be reused after a terminal operation.
- **Debugging Difficulty:** Stream pipelines can be harder to debug than imperative code.
- **Performance:** In some cases, especially with small collections or simple operations, traditional loops may outperform streams.
- **Stateful/Imperative Logic:** Streams are not ideal for deeply imperative or stateful logic.
- **Side Effects:** Streams are designed for stateless operations; using side effects can lead to bugs.

## When to Use Streams
- When you need to transform, filter, or aggregate data in collections.
- For readable, declarative data processing pipelines.
- When you want to leverage parallel processing easily.

## When Not to Use Streams
- In performance-critical code where micro-optimization is required.
- When you need to reuse the same data pipeline multiple times.
- For deeply imperative, stateful, or side-effect-heavy logic.
- When debugging complex logic is a priority.

## Stream Operations Overview

Stream operations are divided into two main types:

### 1. Intermediate Operations
- **Transform the stream** (return another stream)
- **Lazy** (executed only when a terminal operation is invoked)
- Examples: `map`, `filter`, `sorted`, `distinct`, `flatMap`, `peek`, `limit`, `skip`

### 2. Terminal Operations
- **Trigger processing** and produce a result or side effect
- **Close the stream** (cannot be reused)
- Examples: `collect`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `count`, `min`, `max`, `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, `noneMatch`, `findFirst`, `findAny`, `toArray`

## Example Classes & Practice Problems

Each example class in this project:
